# Update Guide

_Note: These docs were adopted from the original
[Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/docs/) docs_

The latest patch notes can be found
[here](https://github.com/revideo/revideo/releases).

To update all the `@revideo` packages to the latest version use the following:

```bash
npm update --save @revideo/2d @revideo/core @revideo/ui @revideo/vite-plugin
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get any errors, try removing `package-lock.json` and the `node_modules`
folder, then run `npm install` again.
