# Deploy a Revideo Project

You can use our CLI to deploy your revideo project, which will expose a web server with endpoints for rendering videos and downloading rendered videos as mp4. To do so, run the following command:

```
npx revideo serve --projectFile vite.config.ts --port 3000
```

The `--port` parameter is optional. By default, the service will use port 4000.
