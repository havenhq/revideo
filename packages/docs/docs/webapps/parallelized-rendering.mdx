# Parallelized Rendering with Serverless Functions

To speed up rendering in production, it's useful to parallelize rendering with
serverless functions using `renderPartialVideo()`
([docs](https://docs.re.video/renderer/renderPartialVideo)). When rendering a 10
minute video, parallelizing across 10 workers would spin up 10 serverless
functions that each render one minute of the video. We have created example
guides for parallelized rendering on AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.

**Note: In our experiments, parallelized Rendering on AWS Lambda performs
significantly faster due to much better cold start times. We highly recommend
using AWS Lambda for rendering instead of Google Cloud Functions**

### Parallelized Rendering on AWS Lambda

You can find the example project for parallelized rendering on AWS Lambda along
with a setup guide
[here](https://github.com/redotvideo/examples/tree/main/parallelized-aws-lambda)

### Parallelized Rendering with Google Cloud Functions
