# Rendering on Google Cloud Run

To avoid using a large VPS even when you're not rendering videos, you might want to deploy a rendering endpoint as a serverless function. One of the options that allow you to do so is [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en) and [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions?hl=en).

### A Basic Rendering Service on Google Cloud Run

We have created an example project that shows you how you can deploy a Revideo project on Cloud Run for rendering. The [repository](https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo-examples/tree/main/google-cloud-run), along with its README, guides you through the whole process.

### Parallelizing Rendering Jobs across Multiple Cloud Functions

You can significantly speed up rendering jobs by parallelizing the workload across many Cloud Functions instead of just one. For instance, to render a 60s video, we can spin up 6 workers that each render 10s of video and afterwards stitch together the partial videos.

You can find a full implementation of parallelized rendering along with a guide in the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo-examples/tree/main/google-cloud-run-parallelized).
