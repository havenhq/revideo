# Rendering Video

You can render your videos and export them as .mp4 files either directly from
the browser or through a node.js function call using the
[renderer](https://github.com/havenhq/revideo/tree/main/packages/renderer)
package.

### Rendering with `renderVideo()`

You can render videos through the node.js function `renderVideo` from the
`@revideo/renderer` package, which uses a headless browser. After the function
has run, your .mp4 file will be located in the output path specified in
`vite.config.ts`, which is `output/project.mp4` by default.

```ts
import {renderVideo} from '@revideo/renderer';

renderVideo('./vite.config.ts');
```

### Rendering from the browser

To render videos from the editor, simply click the "Render" Button:
