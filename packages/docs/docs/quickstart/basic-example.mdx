# Basic Code Example

For now, we can ignore all files in our revideo project except for
`src/scenes/example.tsx`, as this is where the visuals and audio of our video
are defined. Let's walk through all the parts of the code that might confuse
you, and provide explanations and references.

### Defining a generator function

Our animation is defined within a generator function that is passed to
`makeScene2D` - this function describes the sequence of events happening in our
video:

```tsx
import {Audio, Img, Video, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {all, chain, createRef, waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
// your animation flow here
}
```

Generator functions can return multiple values - when they are called, they will
execute until they first encounter a `yield` statement, and return the yielded
value. Revideo renders animations by continually calling the generator function,
which will yield frames that we can export. It is not neccessary to understand
how this works exactly, but if you are interested, you can read about the
animation flow in revideo [here](/flow).

### Adding Video and Audio elements

At the start of our generator function, we add [Video](/api/2d/components/Video)
and [Audio](/api/2d/components/Audio) tags to our `view`, which will display
them on the canvas. Other components you could add include
[Txt](/api/2d/components/Txt) or [Img](/api/2d/components/Img) tags, or basic
shapes like [Rect](api/2d/components/Rect) or
[Circle](api/2d/components/Circle). You can find the API for all components
[here](api/2d/components).

```tsx
yield view.add(
  <>
    <Video
      src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/stars.mp4'}
      play={true}
      size={['100%', '100%']}
    />
    <Audio
      src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/chill-beat.mp3'}
      play={true}
      time={17.0}
    />
  </>,
);
```

A few points about input arguments:

- In both cases, `src` refers to the file, which points to a remote url on the
  bucket. Alternatively, you can use local files by passing their path.
- Passing `size={["100%", "100%"]}` makes the video stretch to the full width
  and height of its canvas.
- Adding `play={true}` makes both media elements play immediately, instead of
  being in a paused state.

### Play media for one second

After adding our background video and audio, we execute

```tsx
yield * waitFor(1);
```

The function [waitFor](/api/core/flow/#waitFor) does - as the name suggests -
nothing. It is particularly useful when waiting for media (like videos and
audio) to play or when we want to have a still-standing image.

### Animating the revideo logo

Lastly, we let the revideo logo spin into our video:

```tsx
view.add(
  <Img
    width={'1%'}
    ref={logoRef}
    src={
      'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/revideo-logo-white.png'
    }
  />,
);

yield *
  chain(
    all(logoRef().scale(40, 2), logoRef().rotation(360, 2)),
    logoRef().scale(60, 1),
  );
```

A few things happen here: First, we add the revideo logo as an
[Img](/api/2d/components/Img) to our canvas. We set its initial width to only 1%
of the screen, as we want it to grow as the video plays. We also pass a
[reference](/references) through `ref={logoRef}`, which we had initialized
before. Like [React refs](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs),
references allow us to access and modify the behavior of elements after they've
been initialized.

In our code, we use a reference to the revideo logo to later animate it.
Particularly, we run the following commands:

- `scale(x, s)`: scales the size of the logo to `x` times its original size,
  within `n` seconds.
- `rotation(d, s)`: rotates the image by `d` degrees within `s` seconds

The flow of these animations is determined by the keywords [chain](/flow/#chain)
and [all](/flow/#all). The former instructs revideo to play its input animations
after one another, while the latter instructs revideo to play them
simultaneously. As a result, we first see the revideo logo rotating around 360
degrees while growing to 40x its original size. After this is done, the logo
still grows to 60x its original size. You can learn more about the animation
flow in revideo [here](/flow).
