# Transparent Video

Revideo supports the use of transparent videos. This is useful when you want to
overlay a video on top of other content, such as a background image or video.

Make sure the transparent video you're using is encoded using the `VP9` codec.
These files usually have a `.webm` extension.

You can use command line tools such as `ffmpeg` to re-encode videos from one
codec to another.

To enable transparency for your source video, you need to set the `transparency`
property of the `<Video/>` component to `true`. If it is set to false, you will
still have transparency during preview, but the rendered video will not be
transparent.

```tsx
<Video src={'your-video.webm'} play={true} transparency={true} />
```

**Note:** There are other video codes that support transparency, such as `HEVC`,
which might show up correctly in the preview through the ui or inside the
player, which will lose their transparency when rendering.

```tsx editor
import {Img, Video, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {waitFor, createRef, useScene} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const avatarRef = createRef<Video>();
  const backgroundRef = createRef<Img>();

  yield view.add(
    <>
      <Img
        src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/mountains.jpg'}
        width={'100%'}
        ref={backgroundRef}
      />
      <Video
        src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/avatar.webm'}
        play={true}
        height={'100%'}
        ref={avatarRef}
        transparency={true}
      />
    </>,
  );

  yield* waitFor(avatarRef().getDuration());
});
```
