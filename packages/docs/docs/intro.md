# Welcome to Revideo!

Revideo lets you create videos programmatically. It is forked from the animation
library [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) and extended to provide
features that are essential for video, such as:

- the ability to integrate and edit Audio
- an API for rendering parameterized videos

We initially built Revideo to provide an open-source alternative to
[Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) that is "good enough", but quickly noticed
that the Motion Canvas API makes it substantially easier to build sophisticated
videos. Below you can find some useful links:
