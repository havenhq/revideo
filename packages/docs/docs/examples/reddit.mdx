# Reddit Post Reader

This example ([Github repository](https://github.com/havenhq/reddit-post-video)) lets you create short videos that read reddit posts to you and show some (usually gameplay) background video, as can be found on platforms like TikTok or YouTube. 

The project consists of two main components:
- A NodeJs Service which receives a post link, extracts its text, and generates speech audio with ElevenLabs
- Revideo frontend that stitches together video and audio and displays the subtitles which it receives as parameters

Here is an example video generated from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1bllfgk/i_hate_having_old_parents/):
