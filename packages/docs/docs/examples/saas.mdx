# Revideo Saas Template

The Revideo Saas Template
([Github](https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo-saas-template/tree/main)) is a
minimal example of a web app built with Revideo. This example application lets
users generate Youtube Shorts from a text description.

<video width="889" height="500" controls>
  <source
    src="https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/saas-template-github.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Project Structure

The Saas Template consists of three main components:

### `/ui`:

This folder contains the frontend code of our project, built as a NextJS project
with the [NextJS App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). It lets users define
inputs such as a description of the video and communicates with the backend in
`/websocket-server` to trigger actions such as the final export of the video.

Notably, the UI also uses the `@revideo/player` package to let users preview the
video and make edits before exporting the video.

### `/revideo`:

This folder contains a revideo project that defines a template for Youtube
Shorts. The template accepts the following variables:

- a list of background images (we use Dall-E generated images)
- an audio file containing a voiceover
- timestamps for each word in the voiceover to display subtitles

A web endpoint for rendering is exposed by running
`npx revideo serve --projectFile vite.config.ts`.

### `/websocket-server`:

This folder contains the main backend logic of our project. It has two main
functionalities:

- When a user submits a description of their Youtube Short, the backend uses
  several AI services to generate assets (e.g. it writes a script with GPT-4 and
  generates background images with Dall-E). These assets are uploaded to an AWS
  bucket, as well as a json file containing the variables of the revideo
  project.
- When a user triggers a video export, the server redirects this request to the
  revideo service and uploads the finished video to the AWS bucket.
