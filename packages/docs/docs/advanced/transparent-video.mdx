# Transparent Video

Revideo supports the use of transparent videos. This is useful when you want to
overlay a video on top of other content, such as a background image or video.

Make sure the transparent video you're using is encoded using the `VP9` codec.
These files usually have a `.webm` extension.

You can use command line tools such as `ffmpeg` to re-encode videos from one
codec to another.

To enable transparency for your source video, you need to set the `transparency`
property of the `<Video/>` component to `true`.

```tsx
<Video src={'/output_with_alpha.webm'} play={true} transparency={true} />
```

**Note:** There are other video codes that support transparency, such as `HEVC`,
which might show up correctly in the preview through the ui or inside the
player, which will lose their transparency when rendering.
