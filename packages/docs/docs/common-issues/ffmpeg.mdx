# FFmpeg Issues

Ffmpeg is a powerful tool for video editing. Revideo uses FFmpeg for multiple
tasks, such as concatinating frames into a video, and audio manipulation among
other things.

Revideo uses FFmpeg v6. To make installation easier, we ship a small version of
FFmpeg with Revideo. It is automatically downloaded into the `node_modules`
folder. This means that you do not need to install FFmpeg globally on your
machine.

:::info

We're currently investigating issues with FFmpeg on Linux (specifically Debian).
If you're having issues with FFmpeg, you can install your own version globally
on your machine using conventional methods and then set the ffmpeg path to a
custom path. Instructions are below. Make sure to install FFmpeg v6.

:::

If you want to use a custom version of FFmpeg, you can set the path to ffmpeg in
the render function. Here is an example:

```tsx
import {renderVideo} from '@revideo/renderer';

// ...

await renderVideo('./vite.config.ts', undefined, undefined, {
  ffmpeg: {
    // Points to the global ffmpeg installation,
    ffmpegPath: 'ffmpeg',
  },
});
```

See the [renderVideo](/renderer/renderVideo) API documentation for more
information.
