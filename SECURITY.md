# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Revideo does not provide a long-term security support for any of its older
versions. Only the newest release is being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please kindly email us at [hello@haven.run](mailto:hello@haven.run)

We are a fork of Motion Canvas, so should you find a security vulnerability that
affects both projects, please also contact them at
[aarthificial+motion-canvas@gmail.com](mailto:aarthificial+motion-canvas@gmail.com)

After receiving a report, we will try to confirm the problem. You should receive
a response within 48 hours, informing you about our plans concerning the
reported issue. If applicable, a fix for the current release we'll be prepared
and deployed to npm as fast as possible.
